# CPP-MIPS-Decoder

In this project I wrote a C/C++ program to decode MIPS machine code. I did not fully disassemble it, but I did output, for each instruction:

The instruction format: R, I, or J  
The opcode  The Rs, Rt, and Rd register numbers  
The immediate value, if any  
The jump address, if any
